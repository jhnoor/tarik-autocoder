# Benchmarks

In order to assess Tarik's progress, we will use a list of increasingly difficult tasks that he must be able to complete.

1. ✅ [**Create a Hello World web page**](https://github.com/tarik-tasktopr/hello-world/issues/1)
1. ✅ [**Implement a basic calculator app**](https://github.com/tarik-tasktopr/calculator/issues/1)
1. ✅ [**Create a simple to-do list app**](https://github.com/tarik-tasktopr/to-do-list/issues/1)
1. ⏳ Integrate a new third-party API into your application
1. Create a real-time chat application using web sockets
1. Implement user authentication and authorization in a web application
1. Analyze an application and make performance, logging, metrics, tracing, and security fixes
1. Deploy a web application to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP)
1. Build a full-stack web application with a modern front-end and back-end framework (e.g., React and Node.js)
1. Develop a mobile application using a cross-platform framework (e.g., React Native or Flutter)

## Benchmarking Process

A repository will be created for each task. The repository will either be empty, have a skeleton, or have a complete application which Tarik will be asked to perform the given task on. The task will be described in an issue that is assigned to Tarik. Tarik will then perform his work and produce a pull request.

## Success criteria

If a human deems the attached pull request as satisfactory, the issue will be closed and the task will be marked as complete.

## Benchmarks in detail

### Integrate a new third-party API into your application

Tarik already has a number of API's in memory, such as openweathermap as demonstrated in [this](https://github.com/tarik-tasktopr/weather-report/issues/1) issue and PR. However, we want to demonstrate browsing ability, so we will direct Tarik to a new API that he has not used before. This will be a simple API that returns a JSON object. The task will be to integrate this API into the application and display the data in a meaningful way.

1. ✅ [**Create a Hello World web page**](https://github.com/tarik-tasktopr/hello-world/issues/1)
1. ✅ [**Implement a basic calculator app**](https://github.com/tarik-tasktopr/calculator/issues/1)

1. Implement user authentication and authorization in a web application

1. Deploy a web application to a cloud service (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP)
1. Build a full-stack web application with a modern front-end and back-end framework (e.g., React and Node.js)
1. Develop a mobile application using a cross-platform framework (e.g., React Native or Flutter)

## Benchmarking Process

A repository will be created for each task. The repository will either be empty, have a skeleton, or have a complete application which Tarik will be asked to perform the given task on. The task will be described in an issue that is assigned to Tarik. Tarik will then perform his work and produce a pull request.

### Success criteria

If a human deems the attached pull request as satisfactory, the issue will be closed and the task will be marked as complete.
